	These are lecture notes for \textsc{phil} 126b, ``Introduction to Modern Philosophy,'' taught by Michael Della Rocca at Yale University during the spring of 2019.
	These notes are not official, and have not been proofread by the instructor for the course.
	They live in my lecture notes respository at 
	\[\text{\url{https://github.com/jopetty/lecture-notes/tree/master/PHIL-126}.}\] 
	If you find any errors, please open a bug report describing the error and label it with the course identifier, or open a pull request so I can correct it.
