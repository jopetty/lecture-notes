	These are lecture notes for \textsc{math} 354b, ``Number Theory,'' taught by 
	Ross Berkowitz at Yale University during the spring of 2019.
	These notes are not official, and have not been proofread by the instructor 
	for the course.
	They live in my lecture notes respository at 
	\[
	\text{\url{https://github.com/jopetty/lecture-notes/tree/master/MATH-354}.}
	\]
	If you find any errors, please open a bug report describing the error and 
	label it with the course identifier, or open a pull request so I can correct 
	it.
